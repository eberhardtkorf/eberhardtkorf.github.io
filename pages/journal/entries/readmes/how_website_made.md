# How This Website Works

# Hosting

This website is hosted using GitHub Pages. The method only allows for static `.html` and `.js` file so the file structure is not as simple as just returning certain files based on the user's request. All the links in the `.html` files have to link to another sort of file so it is not possible to dynamically populate a template page with content. Thus, the number of files necessary to make this website possible will grow along with the website. The contents of this website and the file structure it follows can be seen on the following GitHub repository:

# Styles

Attempts have been made in order to make the viewing of the content as soft on the eye as possible. A few `.css` things that allow this are listed below:

* Background color is a very subtle off white: #EEEEEE
* Text colour is slighyly more grey than black: #444
* A line height of 1.6 is used
* A font size of 18 is used with the Sans-serif family

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
