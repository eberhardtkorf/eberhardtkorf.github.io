# Percentage Drop vs. Needed Gain

### Background

Volatility in any investing market can cause a lot of fear and uncertainty regarding the underlying asset. The movement of prices is often measured on a percentage basis. For example if an asset that was worth $100 yesterday is worth $800 today we would say that the price and in turn the value of your investment fell by 20% because you only have 80% of $100 left. Some might believe that in order for your investment to go back to the value it was when the asset was worth $100 is just the inverse of the amount it dropped, in this case being a rise in 20%. However, this is not the case and a general formula to solve this problem will be developed here.

### Problem

We would like a formula that shows what is the needed gain for an investment to return to an original amount. For example if I lost 15% on my investment, what would be the percentage gain i need to return to the original value before the 15% loss. Thus, we have two variables namely the percentage drop and the percentage gain needed.

### Formulation

We can define the percentage drop as x and the percentage gain needed as y. If we imagine that we started with a $100 investment and our investment is now worth $80, meaning a 20% loss (x=0.2), we can set up a formula that will solve for y, the percentage our investment has to grow to return to $100.
